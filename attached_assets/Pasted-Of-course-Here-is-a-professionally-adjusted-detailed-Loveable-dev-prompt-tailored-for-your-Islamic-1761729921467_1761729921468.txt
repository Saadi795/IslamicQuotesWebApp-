### **Detailed Loveable.dev Prompt: Islamic Quotes App**

### **General Requirements**
- The UI should be **clean, modern, and spiritually serene**, optimized for **both mobile and desktop** to provide a reflective experience anywhere.
- The design should follow the **best UX/UI principles** for content consumption and inspiration.
- Users should be able to **easily interact** with the app through a main dashboard for browsing quotes and buttons to request new content.

---

### **Webhook Integration with n8n**
- The app should **send a request to an n8n webhook** to fetch a new quote and **wait for the response** before displaying it.
- The request to fetch a new quote should be **sent to this webhook**:
  `[INSERT YOUR N8N WEBHOOK URL HERE]`
- The webhook **processes the request** and returns a structured JSON response containing the quote text, its source (e.g., Quran, Hadith), and the chapter/verse number if applicable.
- The app should **dynamically display the new quote** in a beautiful, user-friendly format.

- The app should **send user input to an n8n webhook** and **wait for a response** before displaying results.
- The webhook request **should be sent using the POST method with data formatted as JSON in the request body**. For a simple "get new quote" action, the body can be: `{"action": "get_quote"}` or include parameters like `{"category": "patience"}` if you implement categories later.

### **App-Specific Features**
- The UI should be designed to support **displaying and discovering inspirational Islamic quotes**.
- The main interface should allow users to **view a beautifully presented quote, request a new random quote, and share or bookmark their favorites**.
- The system should provide **a curated, AI-generated (or database-pulled) Islamic quote along with its source and reference**.

### **Design & User Experience**
- **Visual Aesthetic:** **Minimalist, calm, and elegant.** Use a design that inspires peace and reflection. Think of clean layouts with ample whitespace, subtle geometric patterns (Islamic art-inspired), and a serene color palette.
- **Typography & Colors:**
  - **Primary Font:** Use a sophisticated serif font like **Playfair Display** for the quote text to convey tradition and wisdom.
  - **Secondary Font:** Use a clean, readable sans-serif like **Inter** or **Poppins** for the source, buttons, and UI elements.
  - **Color Palette:** Use deep, rich colors like **#0D3B2A (Dark Green)**, **#8DA399 (Sage Green)**, and **#F5F5F5 (Light Off-White)**. Accents can be in gold **#D4AF37** for a premium feel.
- **Navigation & UI Flow:**
  - The app opens to a **main "Card" component** prominently displaying the current quote in large, elegant typography.
  - Below the quote, clearly display the **source (e.g., "Surah Al-Baqarah")** and **verse number (e.g., "2:286")** in a slightly smaller, respectful style.
  - Include a **fixed bottom navigation bar or a floating action button (FAB)** with clear call-to-action buttons:
    - **"New Quote"**: Fetches and displays a new quote from the webhook.
    - **"Bookmark"** (Heart or Bookmark icon): Allows users to save the current quote to a local list.
    - **"Share"** (Share icon): Allows users to share the quote as text or an image.
  - Provide a separate section (e.g., a tab) called **"Bookmarks"** where users can view all their saved quotes in a list.

### **Advanced Features (Optional)**
- Allow users to **bookmark important quotes** for future reference, stored in the browser's local storage.
- Implement **smooth animations** such as a gentle fade-in when a new quote loads.
- Add a **"Copy Text" button** to easily copy the quote and its source to the clipboard.
- **(Future Enhancement)**: Add a **category filter** (e.g., Hope, Patience, Mercy) that users can select before fetching a quote, sending the category to the webhook.

---

### **Deployment Instructions**
- This app should be **fully functional with no additional coding required** after Loveable.dev generates it.
- It should be **optimized for mobile & desktop use**.
- The generated UI should be **fully connected to the n8n webhook backend** to dynamically fetch and display live quotes.
