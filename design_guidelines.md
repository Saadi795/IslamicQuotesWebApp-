# Islamic Quotes App - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**Reference-Based Approach**: Inspired by meditation and mindfulness apps (Calm, Headspace) combined with Islamic art aesthetics - focusing on serenity, reflection, and spiritual peace.

## Core Design Principles
- Minimalist, calm, and elegant aesthetic that inspires peace and reflection
- Clean layouts with ample whitespace and subtle geometric patterns inspired by Islamic art
- Serene, spiritually focused user experience optimized for content consumption
- Mobile-first responsive design for anywhere access

## Typography

**Primary Font**: Playfair Display (serif)
- Quote text: Use large, elegant serif typography (text-3xl to text-5xl on desktop, text-2xl to text-3xl on mobile)
- Weight: 400-500 for quote body, 600-700 for emphasis

**Secondary Font**: Inter or Poppins (sans-serif)
- Source references, buttons, UI elements: text-sm to text-base
- Navigation and labels: text-xs to text-sm
- Weight: 400 for body, 500-600 for headings

## Color Palette

**Primary Colors**:
- Dark Green: `#0D3B2A` - Primary backgrounds, emphasis elements
- Sage Green: `#8DA399` - Secondary accents, borders, hover states
- Light Off-White: `#F5F5F5` - Main background, card surfaces
- Gold: `#D4AF37` - Premium accents, interactive elements, call-to-action highlights

## Layout System

**Spacing Units**: Use Tailwind spacing primitives of 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 (p-4, m-8, gap-6, etc.)

**Container Structure**:
- Main viewport: Full height on mobile, centered max-w-2xl on desktop
- Card component: Generous padding (p-8 to p-12), rounded corners (rounded-2xl), subtle shadow
- Content margins: mx-4 on mobile, mx-auto with max-width on desktop

**Grid System**:
- Single-column layout for quote display (centered, focused)
- Two-column grid for bookmark list on desktop (grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2)

## Component Library
